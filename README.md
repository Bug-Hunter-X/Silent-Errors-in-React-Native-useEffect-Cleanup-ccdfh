# Silent Errors in React Native useEffect Cleanup

This repository demonstrates a common but difficult-to-debug error in React Native applications involving the `useEffect` hook and its cleanup function.  The error manifests silently, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes. The issue arises when the cleanup function attempts to interact with the component's state or props after the component has unmounted. 

## Problem
The problem lies in improper handling of the component's lifecycle within the `useEffect` cleanup function.  If the cleanup function tries to access or modify the component's state or props after the component has unmounted, a silent error occurs.  Standard debugging methods may not reveal the root cause immediately.

## Solution
The solution involves adding a check to ensure the component is still mounted before performing any actions within the cleanup function. This check prevents interaction with stale data and avoids the silent errors.  The `mounted` state variable is used for this purpose.
