This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with a cleanup function that throws an error. This can happen if the cleanup function attempts to access or modify a component's state or props after the component has unmounted.  The error is usually silent, but can manifest as unexpected behavior or crashes.  Debugging is difficult because the error message doesn't directly point to the useEffect cleanup.
